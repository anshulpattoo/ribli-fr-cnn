Cancer bounding box annotations for the INbreast database.

In original annotations many kind of things are marked, mostly not cancers. These can not be used to evaluate the results of a CAD. So we selected the cancerous lesions based on the INBreast metadata, and created our bounding box annotations.

These bounding box annotations can be used in order to evaluate the predicitons of the CAD system.
